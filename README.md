Hello!

I'm Vinicius Mesel (he/his), I've being a web developer (backend) and data-(science|engineering) enthusiast for 6 years!

My main work is on [PyJobs][0] and [RecrutaDev][1], both initiatives to help companies and developers reach out each other and get in touch, so they can find the best fit for the work.

I already worked with Investment Banking at Banco Safra's MFO (Multi-family office) and Itau BBA Private Bank Sales Desk, and I work @ Mais Retorno nowadays as my full-time employment (RecrutaDev contractor).
